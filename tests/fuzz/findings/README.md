# Fuzz Findings

This directory stores minimized crashers and repro information.

## Policy

- Any new crasher found by `tools/fuzz-runner` must be minimized.
- Keep the minimized input under `tests/fuzz/findings/`.
- Add one markdown entry per crasher with:
  - target (`fuzz_parse_syntax` or `fuzz_static_check`)
  - commit hash where found
  - exact repro command
  - expected sanitizer failure signature

## Repro template

```bash
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 \
./tests/fuzz/bin/<target> \
  tests/fuzz/findings/<crasher-file>
```

Raw crashing artifacts generated by libFuzzer are placed in:

- `tests/fuzz/findings/raw/`
