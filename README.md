# ProtoScript2

ProtoScript2 is an experimental scripting language focused on **simplicity, explicitness, and performance**.

It is inspired by the **original prototype-based model of early JavaScript (ES1)**, before classes, syntax sugar, and complex abstractions obscured the core concepts. ProtoScript2 deliberately avoids class-based inheritance and favors **objects, delegation, and explicit construction**.

The language is designed with the following principles:

- **Prototype-based object model** (no classes, no hidden inheritance)

- **Explicit semantics**: what is not written does not exist

- **Minimal runtime**, predictable behavior

- **Performance-oriented design**, close to C-level representations

- **Simple, readable syntax**, without framework-like abstractions

- **Designed to be compiled or transpiled to C** (long-term goal)

ProtoScript2 is not meant to compete with modern JavaScript ecosystems.  
It is a **language for understanding, experimenting, and building small, efficient systems**, where control over execution and memory matters.

## Key goals

- Reclaim the original ideas of prototype-based programming

- Provide a clean semantic model suitable for compilation

- Serve as a research and learning platform for language design

- Explore efficient representations of objects, strings, and collections

---

## Non-goals

- No DOM, no browser APIs

- No class syntax

- No dependency on existing JS runtimes

- No attempt to follow ECMAScript evolution
